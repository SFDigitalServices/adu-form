- title: Are you ready to apply for an ADU?
  fields:
  - label: |
      This application will ask you about:

      - The owner's and agent's contact information

      - Construction details like the project address, cost, and excavation area

      - How you are currently using the land, and how you plan to change it

      - Safety-related topics like fire protection, seismic retrofitting, and worker's compensation insurance

      Then, we'll ask you to upload your plans as PDFs and agree to our legal terms.

      If you are not building the ADU yourself, you might need a professional to help you answer some questions. If you have not yet hired a architect, contractor or engineer, you may want to do so before applying.

      This is not a building permit. Until we issue a permit to you, you cannot start work, change the property's occupancy, or change its use. (See the San Francisco Building Code and San Francisco Housing Code.)

      Once we issue a building permit, you must post it at the job. The owner will also be responsible for keeping the approved plans and permit application at the property.

      No one can occupy the ADU until you or your company have a certificate of final completion posted on the building.

      You will need to follow any stipulations that come up in your application and inspections. You must also follow building code.

    label: About unlicensed workers
    level: 5

  - type: paragraph
    label: |

      You only need to apply for this permit if you are responsible for construction, and are not hiring a licensed Contractor.

      Unlicensed workers often tell property owners to apply for an "Owner-Builder" building permit, which makes the owner imply they are providing their own labor and materials. This makes them the responsible party of record on the permit.

      If you work with anyone other than California licensed Contractors on this project, and it costs $500 or more (including labor and materials), you may be considered as an "employer" under state and federal law.

      "Employers" must:

      - Register with the state and federal government

      - Withhold payroll taxes

      - Provide worker's compensation disability insurance

      - Contribute to unemployment compensation for each employee

      If you fail to follow these laws, you may be exposing yourself to serious financial risk.

      If you lose money after contracting an unlicensed worker and file a complaint, the Contractors’ State License Board might not be able to help you. Your only remedy against unlicensed Contractors may be in civil court.

      If an unlicensed worker or their employees are injured while working on your property, you may be held liable for damages. Homeowner's insurance may not provide coverage for these injuries.

    label: Protecting yourself

      You can prevent this risk by hiring a licensed Contractor, and filing the permit in their name instead.

      Licensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public. These laws require contractors to be licensed and bonded in California. Contractors must also write their license numbers on permits and contracts.

      After receiving an Owner-Builder permit, you may decide to hire Contractors instead. If this happens, you will need to verify whether they:

      - Are licensed in California

      - Have current workers' compensation insurance coverage
